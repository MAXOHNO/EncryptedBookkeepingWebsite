===================

Date: 6 April 2021

Although BUCH.HALTUNG is subject to German law and not subject to laws such as the US Patriot Act, in the interests of transparency and accountability, we will be issuing a monthly "warrant canary" within the first week of each calendar month. This will protect BUCH.HALTUNG users in the event we are required by law to be silent about any searches, seizures of data or requirements to log.

Special note should be taken should this messages ceased to be updated or are removed from this page.

No warrants have ever been served to BUCH.HALTUNG, BUCH.HALTUNG's principals or its employees.
No searches or seizures of any kind have ever been performed on our assets nor has there been any request for us to log information.
